## Welcome to App Development Challenge!

### Problem

Challenge is to create a cloud based todo app using firebase as backend. The app should also display a quote of the day at the top of the home page. Use the this Quote API [quotes.rest](https://quotes.rest/) to fetch the quote of the day. 

Sending a GET request to [https://quotes.rest/qod](https://quotes.rest/qod) will fetch a quote.

### Things to keep in Mind #Rules

Usage of Flutter Framework is highly appreciated. If you don't know Flutter you can use basic Java or Kotlin to complete the task.

Maintain a clean commit history and add comments wherever necessary. The code should be easily readable.

Try your best to complete the challenge. This challenge is curated to tests your UI designing skills and making REST API calls which is very important for this project.

Even if you could not complete the challenge, do whatever you can but with perfection.

Try to keep the app simple, easy to use, and beautiful

Happy Coding!
